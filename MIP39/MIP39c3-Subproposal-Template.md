## Sentence Summary

## Paragraph Summary

## Specification

### Motivation

#### Summary of reason for offboarding
*State the argument for offboarding.*

#### Explicit deliverables and responsibilities
*List deliverables and responsibilities from the Core Unitâ€™s MIP39 mandate, as well as any other specifically declared deliverables and responsibilities (link to source when possible).*

#### Implicit deliverables and responsibilities
*List deliverables and responsibilities implied by the Core Unit (link to source when possible).*

#### Examples of unfulfilled deliverables and responsibilities:
*List examples of unmet or poorly executed deliverables and responsibilities.*
#### Core Unit Unwinding -- Work 

*Please detail the necessary minimum Powers a Facilitator or Interim Facilitator must retain (see [MIP41c2](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Core-Unit-Offboarding-Process-Amendment/MIP41.md)) to conduct unwinding.*

*From the deliverables and responsibilities detailed above, please articulate how **each** objective/deliverable/responsibility will either be completed, delegated to another core unit, or archived with supplemental documentation.*

****If*** relevant, document how the Former or Interim Facilitator will adjust, transfer, or discontinue ***any or some*** of the following: services, initiatives, assets, infrastructure, subscriptions, and contracts.*

#### Core Unit Unwinding -- Funds

*If the Core Unit does not have an unwinding plan for its funds in its MIP40c3, articulate unwinding costs associated with transitioning work tasks within this MIP39 component. Otherwise use the unwinding and defunding plan from a new [MIP40c3](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Core-Unit-Offboarding-Process-Amendment/MIP40/MIP40c3-Subproposal-Template.md) and submit that alongside the offboarding proposal.*

*An unwinding should happen as fast as possible for as little as possible to reduce overhead. Since unwinding activities must complete by four months the maximum allowable severance funds are 33% of the Core Unit's yearly operating costs.*

#### Possible remedy to avoid offboarding
*Suggest a path to accountability for the Core Unit, so the offboarding proposal could be withdrawn. (Optional & recommended)*
