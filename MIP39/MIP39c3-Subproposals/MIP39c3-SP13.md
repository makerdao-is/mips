## Sentence Summary

This post notifies Governance of Immunefi Security Core Unit (ISCU-001) end of operations.

## Paragraph Summary

With Core Units winding down, we are formally notifying Governance of our voluntary offboarding. The Core Unit team will carry on a similar mandate under Ecosystem.

## Specification

### Motivation

#### Summary of reason for offboarding

The Core Unit framework is deprecated.

#### Work

All ongoing work and responsibilities are continued. Expect no interruption in service.

#### Funds
Continuing funding will be coming from the Ecosystem budget. We're working with the Governance facilitators to implement the following budgetary actions on-chain:

**Related to Core Unit offboarding:**
* The FTE was reduced from 1.2 to 0.8 around Jul 2022 with the corresponding MKR vesting schedule adjusted Aug 2023. The FTE was reduced again from 0.8 to 0.4 around Jan 2023. We request payout of MKR vested 05 Aug 2023 adjusted to 0.4 FTE: One time MKR payment to ISCU of 6.34 MKR.
* Termination of DAI streams to ISCU
* We'll our swap ETH holdings to DAI and return *all* remaining DAI holdings in the operational wallet & auditor wallet to the protocol through `DssBlow`.

#### Facilitator
As MIP41c4 does not apply to Ecosystem Actors, we can mark MIP41c4-SP25 as obsolete.

### Core Unit ID

* IS-001
